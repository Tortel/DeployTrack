    <p>Welcome to Deployment Tracker v2.0</p>

    <p>This version includes a complete redesign to Material Design (Android 5) design patterns,
        and some new features.</p>
    <p>The most important new feature is the screen shot mode button. Please remember the principles
        of OPSEC and protect all sesnitive information! To activate screen shot mode, tap the camera
        icon at the top left. This mode hides everything except the circle graph to protect information.</p>
    <p>Other new features in version 2: <br />
       * No more limit on the length of the name <br />
       * Theme changes apply right away <br />
       * When widgets change vertical/horizontal layouts was tweaked <br />
       * Performance improvements <br />
